Our story begins with the creepy ass city Oceanside, which, unlike its name, was hundreds of miles far from any big water thingy. The biggest thing justifying its name was a lake touching the edge of the city border like a 11 year old kid on the edge of sanity after discovering Harry Potter eroticas. You'd ask why's it creepy, and the simplest answer for that would be the fact that it was the haven for the greeds of the privileged. Oceanside's populations ranged from paedophilic corpos to homeless people getting by on scraps. And just like every other city, it was full of corrupt cops, clueless politicians and the worst of them all: people who can't keep the trash in their pockets until they see a trashcan. In fact, the only thing between Oceanside and copyright infringement was the lack of Batman.
<br><br>
 Andre had only been in Oceanside for a couple of years but yet managed to get a reputation amongst the pretentious yoga loving entrepreneurs living in Varsity, the part of Oceanside inhabited by actors, influencers, and people who were rich enough to own the villas as their summer home. Himself living in the suburbs, he had a strict daily schedule, a very sleek approach to fashion, a streak of not taking a leave from his job as a tutor of mental peace, a rented two room flat to call home and a crippling drug addiction. Andre moved to Oceanside seeing an opportunity to fulfil his dream of acting. He started a new life with the help of his pal James, who had scored himself a flashy position at the most popular coke brand throughout western Europe, Cola Pinada. It was James’ dream to make sure every adult and child has affordable access to coke. Driving inspiration from the entirely expected demise of Andre’s father due to lack of proper rehabilitation facilities, he was close to achieving his dream of ensuring easy access to cocaine and other under-the-counter drugs to all by binding politicians and influential people in serving his cause, either by blackmailing or by threatening their image by setting them up.
<br><br>
James’ success had scored him a villa in Varsity with his career. He lived a life of luxury as a divorced middle aged man with no alimony to pay after his ex-wife disappeared under mysterious circumstances. The only other breathing thing that he willingly shared his apartment with was his pet cane toad named Herriot, who was mostly found in James’ pockets, or in his luxurious 30 square inch hellhole of an aquarium.
<br><br>
No one really knew that the flashy success of Cola Pinada and the multiple lawsuits against James, that were easy for him to avoid thanks to his never ending riches, were nothing but a ruse. James never felt truly happy, ever since he was an edgy teenager watching popular satire shows and listening to indie songs thinking that his music taste made him different than others around him, writing edgy stories trying to show profoundness in his shallow words that he himself was too naive to understand, he had always been sad about his pathetic life, about his inability to make use of the privileges he had, about disappointing or letting down everyone who ever put their trust in him, about his overdramatic and diplomatic way of expressing his thoughts and beliefs, about his inability to bring a change in anything amongst his hatred for everything that defined him. He had everything someone his age could’ve ever wanted, everything that he never deserved, never worked for, and yet he never made use of those opportunities.
<br><br>
Every day he woke up, and got on with his days, despite never seeing a meaning behind what he was doing, despite never feeling like he’s serving a purpose, despite feeling like none of his actions have a point. Even though he never understood why.
<br><br>
Andre, on the other hand, lived a life that an average person used as mythologising self-deprecation, or an exaggerated image of their condition. The country he spent his childhood and early adulthood in got into civil-war cause of political conflicts and ideals of cultural supremacy. Being a healthy adult, he got signed up in the army to help fight for a cause that he had nothing to do with since the other option was getting harassed and beaten up by the same army. And remembering stories that his online pal James had told him about Oceanside and the incitements that came along with the dream of being a part of a movie, being a part of something where he mattered, overwhelmed him to the point where he crossed borders hiding in an arms supply containers on board of a ship. Andre sailed through there for what felt like days, surviving on the bare minimum he had stuffed in his pockets. Holding on to his breath constantly reminding himself of what the future held for him.
<br><br>
After reaching Oceanside, his heart welled up as he saw himself a stone’s throw away from fame. He contacted James using the phone he smuggled along and James set him up with a hotel room in the sub-urban, crime ridden areas of the island since it wasn’t safe for him to keep an illegal immigrant in a villa surrounded by intrusive folks who’d rat them out to authorities the second they got even a hint of something wrong going on. And partially because James didn’t want to deal with people if he could avoid it.
<br><br>
Andre was thankful for what James did for him, and he did have a hint of James’ closed off nature being a reason behind him not inviting him to the villa. Andre tried getting himself ready to face auditions and castings, but everything that he witnessed in his country and everything he had to do to get here kept resurfacing to his mind. Haunting his dreams as well as every moment he spent awake were the faces of everyone he ever cared about, and everyone that the army took from him. Few auditions came up and Andre bombed at them, with performances so awful that the judges had to rethink every choice they made that led to this moment. It was that moment when he turned the recreational drugs to get rid of his over suffocating thoughts and nightmares. And he noticed how much better that made him. He was showing perfectly timed reactions, perfect delivery of non political punchlines and the acceptable presentation of generic slapstick jokes. The more he depended on the weed, the better his auditions went. For a moment, legalisation of medical marijuana in so many first world countries started making sense to him. But that high didn’t last for long.
<br><br>
Audition after audition went by. James kept checking up on him every now and then. The judges showed genuine signs of being impressed by his performances on multiple occasions. But despite all that, he hadn’t managed to land a single gig to work on. It was always a role as a side character hanging out in the backgrounds and that was something Andre never wanted to work as. Eventually, he started looking into the movies that he auditioned for, the advertisements where he tried landing a role, and everywhere he saw, only sellable faces got an actual role that mattered. Established celebrities, indie artists who blew up after being a part of some media that caught the attention of the internet, or just new faces recommended by sponsors due to their connections and obligations.
<br><br>
All of that broke Andre to the point where he burnt all the stashes he had saved for himself (not a great choice) and let the buried emotions eat him. Every day getting worse and worse. He stopped trying to look for opportunities. And had relapsed cause of his dealer getting arrested on charges of armed robbery at a local store. His only option was to get help from James, whose calls he had been ignoring for weeks, whose knocks on the door were unheard by his shivering ears. Andre knew the risks of what he was getting into, or at least he thought he did, and so did James’. That was the major reason why instead of letting Andre get addicted to harsher drugs, he got him in a rehab facility. Despite having second thoughts on the inside, on the outside, Andre was grateful to James. Weeks went by with life going the same way. Months passed and out of nowhere, Andre’s condition seemed to have suddenly gotten better. Well, mainly cause he got himself another dealer and got out of the under-funded rehab plan where the instructor had zero fucks to give about him.
<br><br>
Andre had always been good at reading people, especially while under the influence. It didn’t take him long to read the pretentious nature of the privileged. And to cash out on it, he started his business as a tutor for mental peace. Strolling around rich people who could turn him in any second if they found out about him being an illegal immigrant as he had nothing to lose.
<br><br>
James had realised Andre was addicted again but felt powerless to do anything about it. And that’s where things stood today, an year and half later. Andre making money off of entrepreneurs and James still waking up not knowing why he does that every morning.
